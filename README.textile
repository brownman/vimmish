h1. Speak vimmish?

vimmish translates a "vim input stream" to human-readable text:

*From*

<pre><code>iDon't know vim :(.<ESC>^2WBc2wbetter now<ESC><RIGHT>Da.<ESC>II can understan<ESC><RIGHT>~dE</code></pre>

*To*

<pre><code>
                   i => insert before cursor: 
  Don't know vim :(. => type Don't know vim :(.
               <ESC> => go to normal mode
                   ^ => move to the begining of the line (not blank character)
                  2W => move to the begining of the next space-separated word, 2 times
                   B => move backwards one space-separated-word
                 c2w => change to the begining of the next word, 2 times
          better now => type better now
               <ESC> => go to normal mode
             <RIGHT> => move one character to the right

                   a => append after cursor: 
                   . => type .
               <ESC> => go to normal mode
                   I => insert to the begining of the current line:
